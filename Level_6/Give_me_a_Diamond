/*You need to return a string that displays a diamond shape on the screen using asterisk ("*") characters. 
*Please see provided test cases for exact output format.
*The shape that will be returned from print method resembles a diamond, where the number provided as input represents the number of *’s printed on the middle line. 
*The line above and below will be centered and will have 2 less *’s than the middle line. 
*This reduction by 2 *’s for each line continues until a line with a single * is printed at the top and bottom of the figure.
*Return null if input is even number or negative (as it is not possible to print diamond with even number or negative number).
*Example for 5: 
* "  *\n"
* " ***\n"
* "*****\n"
* " ***\n"
* "  *\n" */

//Solution:
class Diamond {
  public static String print(int n) {
    String diamond = "";
    if(n<0|| n%2==0) return null;
    for(int i=1;i<=n;i+=2){
      for(int j=(n-i)/2;j>0;j--) diamond+=" ";
      for(int j=0;j<i;j++)diamond+="*";
      diamond+="\n";
    }    
    for(int i=n-2;i>0;i-=2){
      for(int j=(n-i)/2;j>0;j--) diamond+=" ";
      for(int j=0;j<i;j++) diamond+="*";
      diamond+="\n";
    }
    return diamond;
  }
}
